# Color definitions. Any value in this section must be a ChatColor name.
# Custom values can be defined, however, the defaults are used internally for various purposes.
# Any custom values can then be used in other language sections via {COLOR:subpath}

# All ChatColor names are also supported, e.g. {COLOR:aqua} is ChatColor.AQUA.
